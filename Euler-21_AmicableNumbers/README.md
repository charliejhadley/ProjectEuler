# Amicable Numbers

Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

```Mathematica
primesUnder10100 = eratosSieve[100100.][[2]];
divisorsUnder10000 = Map[
   With[{dvsrs = divisors[#, primesUnder10100, "Sum"]},
     {#, dvsrs, divisors[N@dvsrs, primesUnder10100, "Sum"]}
     ]
    &, N@Range[10000]];
 Total[Cases[
   divisorsUnder10000, {a_, b_, c_} /; a == c && a =!= b][[All, 1]]]
```
