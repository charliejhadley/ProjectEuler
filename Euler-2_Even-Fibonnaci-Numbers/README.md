# Even Fibonnaci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```Mathematica
<<Euler2`
(i=1;
crnt=0;
less4Million=Reap[While[crnt<4*10^6,crnt=Sow[fib[i]];i++]][[2,1,;;-2]];
Total[Select[less4Million,EvenQ]])
```
